        <h2>My First Job</h2>
        <p>At my first job I started as a Customer Service Representative for a company that manufactured and sold standing desks and other office equipment. While working directly with customers was awesome, I took a liking to the Marketing aspect of the business.</p>
        <p> I began learning all about marketing from the marketing manager and quickly jumped into the role of E-Commerce Marketing Analyst</p>
        <p> I took on a LOT of responsibility and fully managed the Amazon storefront our company had.</p>

    <section id = "recent-job">
        <h2>My Most Recent Job</h2>
        <p>I recently decided to leave my position as Front Office Manager at a busy orthodontist office.</p>
        <p>There I took on even more responsibility including patient finances and insurance coordination.</p>
        <p>When Coronavirus took the world by storm, I decided that I wanted my life to take a different path and discovered web design.</p>

    <section id = "now">
        <h2>So, What Am I Doing Now?</h2>
        <p>I'm currently enrolled in a Techdegree program offered by Treehouse</p>
        <p>I've just completed coursework in HTML and CSS which brought me to this very site as my first project!</p>
        <p> I'm incredibly excited about all I have learned so far and ready to keep going to achieve my dreams!</p>
